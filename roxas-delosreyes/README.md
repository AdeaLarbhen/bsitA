ARTXYNA is the name of Yna Marie G. Camposano's business wherein she creates art in phone cases, acrylic glasses, and key chains. She wanted to expand her business, spefically the negotiation between her and her clients from a far away distance. Which is why the developers decided, including the business owner, Yna, that they create a website that promotes her work and to have another form of request in commissions.
