PROJECT NAME:RAE'S MENU

    Rae’s Menu Started way back in 2021 during the time of pandemic or Covid 19. Just like other people who try to seek a job, it was the same with the founder of Rae’s Menu. Most of those unemployed people started doing Online Selling. So Rae Anne, the founder of this business started to do research on what is more appropriate to sell in their location. In addition to her reason is her skills in cooking. Which is why she decided to sell dishes that are new to customers. Rae’s Menu Contains dishes that are new to most of the town people in Laguna. They also offer desserts and Pasta.
    One of the Developers in this project is Hannah Rae Bunye who is also the sister of the Founder. The other Developer is Raina Gemanel, who’s a friend of Hannah Rae. They’ve decided to choose this topic among two choices, they chose the topic that was more unique and supported our own business. This Project is created solely to promote and encourage buyers to kindly visit and try the Dishes in Rae’s Menu.
